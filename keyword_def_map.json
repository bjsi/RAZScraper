A way of representing how likely two events are relative to each other. E.g., if I have no information about which day of the week it is, the odds are 1:6 that it\u2019s Sunday. This is the same as saying that \"it's Sunday\" has a prior probability of 1/7. If <i>x</i>:<i>y</i> is the odds ratio, the probability of <i>x</i> is <i>x</i> / (<i>x</i> + <i>y</i>).<br/><br/>Likewise, to convert a probability <i>p</i> into an odds ratio, I can just write <i>p</i>\u00a0: (1 - <i>p</i>). For a percent probability <i>p</i>%, this becomes <i>p</i>\u00a0: (100 - <i>p</i>). E.g., if my probability of winning a race is 40%, my odds are 40:60, which can also be written 2:3.<br/><br/>Odds ratios are useful because they're usually the easiest way to calculate a Bayesian update. If I notice the mall is closing early, and that\u2019s twice as likely to happen on a Sunday as it is on a non-Sunday (a likelihood ratio of 2:1), I can simply multiply the left and right sides of my prior it\u2019s Sunday (1:6) by the evidence\u2019s likelihood ratio (2:1) to arrive at a correct posterior probability of 2:6, or 1:3.", "OLPC": "<b>OLPC</b>. <i>See \u201cOne Laptop Per Child.\u201d</i>", "Omega": "<b>Omega</b>.

Still, I pay an opportunity cost of $10 for missing a chance to gain something I want. I lose $10 relative to the $110 I <i>could</i> have had.
